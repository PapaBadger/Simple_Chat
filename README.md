# Simple_Chat
ITP Semester Project, BIF 2

21.03.24 : 10:30 
Added previous Ajax homework to the project as the backend structure will help with implementation of
chat logic. It is currently not hooked into index.html

Further websockets will be needed for communication between users, more research needed.
Some functions were deleted from the original homework

Person changed to User.

Furthermore I removed the queries as those are not neccesary in their original form.
